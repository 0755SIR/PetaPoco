Originally the brainchild of [Brad Robinson],

## PetaPoco is a tiny, fast, single-file micro-ORM for .NET and Mono.

* Like [Massive] it's a single file that you easily add to any project
* Unlike [Massive] it works with strongly typed [POCO]'s
* Like [Massive], it now also supports dynamic Expandos too - [read more](http://www.toptensoftware.com/blog/posts/104-PetaPoco-Not-So-Poco-or-adding-support-for-dynamic)
* Like [ActiveRecord], it supports a close relationship between object and database table
* Like [SubSonic], it supports generation of poco classes with T4 templates
* Like [Dapper], it's fast because it uses dynamic method generation (MSIL) to assign column values to properties

---
## Features at a Glance

* Tiny, no dependencies... a single C# file you can easily add to any project.
* Works with strictly undecorated POCOs, or attributed almost-POCOs.
* Helper methods for Insert/Delete/Update/Save and IsNew
* Paged requests automatically work out total record count and fetch a specific page.
* Easy transaction support.
* Better parameter replacement support, including grabbing named parameters from object properties.
* Great performance by eliminating Linq and fast property assignment with DynamicMethod generation.
* Includes T4 templates to automatically generate POCO classes for you.
* The query language is SQL... no weird fluent or Linq syntaxes (yes, matter of opinion)
* Includes a low friction SQL builder class that makes writing inline SQL *much* easier.
* Hooks for logging exceptions, installing value converters and mapping columns to properties without attributes.
* Works with SQL Server, SQL Server CE, MySQL, PostgreSQL and Oracle.
* Works under .NET 4.0/4.5/4.6 or Mono 2.8 and later.
* Experimental support for `dynamic` under .NET 4.0 and Mono 2.8
* [Xunit] unit tests.
* OpenSource (Apache License)
* All of this in about 1,500 lines of code
