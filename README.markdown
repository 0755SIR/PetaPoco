# PetaPoco #

<h2 class="tagline">A tiny ORM-ish thing for your POCOs</h2>

PetaPoco is a tiny .NET data access layer inspired by Rob Conery's [Massive](http://blog.wekeroad.com/helpy-stuff/and-i-shall-call-it-massive) 
project but for use with non-dynamic [POCO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_Old_CLR_Object) objects.  It came about because I was finding
many of my projects that used SubSonic/Linq were slow or becoming mixed bags of Linq and [CodingHorror](http://www.subsonicproject.com/docs/CodingHorror).
